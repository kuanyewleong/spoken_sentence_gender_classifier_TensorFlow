# Identify one's gender through spoken sentence with a generative model built with TensorFlow

This is a small project with huge data sets to classify the speaker's gender based on his/her spoken sentence through a machine learning approach.

The data provided here are normalized using feature standardization. We first determine the distribution mean and standard deviation for each feature. Next we subtract the mean from each feature. Then we divide the values (mean is already subtracted) of each feature by its standard deviation.
